# STD BUS Card Template

## Notes
This project was created with KiCad version 8, and probably wont open in older versions.

## Tips for use
If you keep the board outline in place (critical features are locked by default), or at least aligned to a 0.1"/2.54mm grid, then placement of the card edge connector footprint can be achieved effortlessly using a 0.05"/1.27mm grid.
